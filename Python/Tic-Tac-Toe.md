### **Scenario**

Your task is to write **a simple program which pretends to play tic-tac-toe with the user**. To make it all easier for you, we've decided to simplify the game. Here are our assumptions:

- the computer (i.e., your program) should play the game using `X`s;
- the user (e.g., you) should play the game using `O`s;
- the first move belongs to the computer − it always puts its first `X` in the middle of the board;
- all the squares are numbered row by row starting with `1` (see the example session below for reference)
- the user inputs their move by entering the number of the square they choose − the number must be valid, i.e., it must be an integer, it must be greater than `0` and less than `10`, and it cannot point to a field which is already occupied;
- the program checks if the game is over − there are four possible verdicts: the game should continue, the game ends with a tie, you win, or the computer wins;
- the computer responds with its move and the check is repeated;
- don't implement any form of artificial intelligence − a random field choice made by the computer is good enough for the game.



### Requirement
Implement the following features:
- the board should be stored as a three-element list, while each element is another three-element list (the inner lists represent rows) so that all of the squares may be accessed using the following syntax:
  `board[row][column]`

- each of the inner list's elements can contain `O`, `X`, or a digit representing the square's number (such a square is considered free)
- the board's appearance should be exactly the same as the one presented in the example.
- implement the functions defined for you in the editor.


Drawing a random integer number can be done by utilizing a Python function called `randrange()`. The example program below shows how to use it (the program prints ten random numbers from 0 to 8).

Note: the `from-import` instruction provides access to the `randrange` function defined within an external Python module callled `random`.

︲ from random import randrange     
︲
︲ for i in range(10):             
︲    print(randrange(8))              
︲


### Solution

from random import randrange

def display_board(board):
	print("+-------" * 3,"+", sep="")
	for row in range(3):
		print("|       " * 3,"|", sep="")
		for col in range(3):
			print("|   " + str(board[row][col]) + "   ", end="")
		print("|")
		print("|       " * 3,"|",sep="")
		print("+-------" * 3,"+",sep="")

	ok = False	# fake assumption - we need it to enter the loop
	while not ok:
		move = input("Enter your move: ") 
		ok = len(move) == 1 and move >= '1' and move <= '9' # is user's input valid?
		if not ok:
			print("Bad move - repeat your input!") # no, it isn't - do the input again
			continue
		move = int(move) - 1 	# cell's number from 0 to 8
		row = move // 3 	# cell's row
		col = move % 3		# cell's column
		sign = board[row][col]	# check the selected square
		ok = sign not in ['O','X'] 
		if not ok:	# it's occupied - to the input again
			print("Field already occupied - repeat your input!")
			continue
	board[row][col] = 'O' 	# set '0' at the selected square

	free = []	
	for row in range(3): # iterate through rows
		for col in range(3): # iterate through columns

	return free

	elif sgn == "O": # ... or for O?
		who = 'you'	# yes - it's our side
	else:
		who = None	# we should not fall here!
	cross1 = cross2 = True  # for diagonals
	for rc in range(3):
		if board[rc][0] == sgn and board[rc][1] == sgn and board[rc][2] == sgn:	# check row rc
			return who
		if board[0][rc] == sgn and board[1][rc] == sgn and board[2][rc] == sgn: # check column rc
			return who
		if board[rc][rc] != sgn: # check 1st diagonal
			cross1 = False
		if board[2 - rc][2 - rc] != sgn: # check 2nd diagonal
			cross2 = False
	if cross1 or cross2:
		return who
	return None


def draw_move(board):
	free = make_list_of_free_fields(board) # make a list of free fields
	cnt = len(free)
	if cnt > 0:	
		this = randrange(cnt)
		row, col = free[this]
		board[row][col] = 'X'


board = [ [3 * j + i + 1 for i in range(3)] for j in range(3) ] 
board[1][1] = 'X' # set first 'X' in the middle
free = make_list_of_free_fields(board)
human_turn = True # which turn is it now?
while len(free):
	display_board(board)
	if human_turn:
		enter_move(board)
		victor = victory_for(board,'O')
	else:	
		draw_move(board)
		victor = victory_for(board,'X')
	if victor != None:
		break
	human_turn = not human_turn		
	free = make_list_of_free_fields(board)

display_board(board)
if victor == 'you':
	print("You won!")
elif victor == 'me':
	print("I won")
else:
	print("Tie!")
